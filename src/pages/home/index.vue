        >.
        The main objective of OCR-D is the conceptual and technical preparation of the full-text
        transformation of printed works published in the German-speaking world between the 16th and
        18th centuries. The task of automatic full-text recognition is broken down into its individual
        process steps, which can be reproduced in the open source OCR-D software. This makes it
        possible to create optimal workflows and generate scientifically usable full texts. OLA-HD
        offers a service for the long-term archiving of these results.
