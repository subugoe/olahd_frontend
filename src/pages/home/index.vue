      OLA-HD is funded by the DFG initiative
      <a class="text-sky-500 hover:text-sky-700" href="https://ocr-d.de/en"
        >OCR-D</a
      >.
      The main objective of OCR-D is the conceptual and technical preparation of the full-text
      transformation of printed works published in the German-speaking world between the 16th and
      18th centuries. The task of automatic full-text recognition is broken down into its individual
      process steps, which can be reproduced in the open source OCR-D software. This makes it
      possible to create optimal workflows and generate scientifically usable full texts. OLA-HD
      offers a service for the long-term archiving of these results.
